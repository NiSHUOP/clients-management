    <p className='about w-75 m-auto mt-4'>My project is a comprehensive, full-stack client management application that
       utilizes <strong>ReactJS</strong> for the front end and <strong>Firebase</strong> for the back end. The application is designed to manage client information 
       efficiently, implementing <strong>CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations</strong> to ensure dynamic and responsive user interaction. 
       ReactJS provides a robust and flexible user interface, while Firebase offers a scalable and real-time backend solution, facilitating 
       seamless data synchronization and authentication. This project showcases my proficiency in modern web development
       technologies and my ability to build functional, user-centric applications.</p>
